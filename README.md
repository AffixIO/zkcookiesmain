# zkcookiesmain

## Project Overview

zkcookiesmain is a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)-based project developed by AffixIO, focused on privacy-preserving management of browser cookies or authentication data.

Leveraging advanced zero-knowledge cryptography, this repository likely implements techniques to handle, store, or verify cookies (or cookie-derived credentials) in a way that preserves user privacy — proving validity or ownership without revealing the underlying data.

This aligns with AffixIO's expertise in ZKP development tools, offline verification, and stateless cryptographic systems.

## Features (Expected/Planned)

- Zero-knowledge proofs for cookie validation
- Privacy-enhanced session management
- Integration with web authentication flows
- Offline-capable verification (using AffixIO's patent-pending technology)
- Secure handling of sensitive browser data without exposure
